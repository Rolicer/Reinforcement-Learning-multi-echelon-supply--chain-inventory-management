# Applying reinforcement learning algorithms to multi-echelon supply chain inventory management with uncertain seasonal demands

## Overview:
This project was part of my Bachelor Thesis, where I applied different reinforcement algorithms to multi-echelon supply chain inventory management with uncertain seasonal demands.

## Technologies used:
- **Model & Environment creation:** Python (gym, networkx, or_gym, matplotlib)
- **Reinforcement Learning application:** Python (stable_baselines3, sb3_contrib)
- **Results analysis:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib & Seaborn)

## Lessons learned:
- Theory & math behind Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, especially Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Augmented Random Search (ARS).
- Adjusting existing supply chain models to usable code in Reinforcement Learning Libraries
- Application of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms as well as comparing them against each other using graphs and various output variables.
- How to write a scientific paper using LaTeX with pseudo-code, graphs and formulas

## Supply Chain Environment:
The Supply Chain Environment was based on the Library OR_gym (https://github.com/hubbs5/or-gym, https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06319)
